2013-03-13 22:28:26	MonteCo[Cloud]	if like 15 out of 19 of your "famous dropouts" were going to an ivy league school for the hardest major possible, you're not exactly selling the idea that anyone could be the next bill gates
2013-03-13 22:28:37	MonteCo[Cloud]	you're just saying that if you were that good, you'd probably already be that good

2013-03-14 11:02:49	mortini	[17:35:38] and they were talking about the qualifications of the new pope
2013-03-14 11:02:49	mortini	[17:35:49] i was wondering if one of the qualifications was covering up sex scandals

2013-03-14 11:02:49	caesararum_	[17:49:25] there was something similar in the pilot

2013-03-14 11:02:49	caesararum_	[17:56:19] pregnancy is intrinsically a one-party affair, though

2013-03-14 11:16:05	caesararum_	so you want "sim model builder" or "sim urban planner" where you build something and then don't concern yourself with how it would work in real life?

2013-03-14 11:16:33	fancybone	yeah, I just like building and decorating houses.
2013-03-14 11:16:35	mortini	but
2013-03-14 11:16:37	mortini	it was mostly just buggy as shit
2013-03-14 11:16:43	mortini	once your city gets to x size
2013-03-14 11:16:46	mortini	it just grinds to a halt

2013-03-14 11:18:11	caesararum_	and Sim City 4 is basically "transit problem simulator"
2013-03-14 11:19:52	caesararum_	I told a friend the other day that I would rather make Minecraft AIs than play minecraft
2013-03-14 11:20:12	caesararum_	I'd rather see emergent effects develop than express my own will directly

2013-03-14 11:26:58	mortini	really it's water, power, waste removal and transit
2013-03-14 11:27:11	fancybone	in real life, or in simcity?
2013-03-14 11:27:20	mortini	in real life
2013-03-14 11:28:08	mortini	like, the old parts of colorado springs are specifically studied because when they laid out the city, they made wide streets
2013-03-14 11:28:22	mortini	they're kinda like park ave - 2 lanes, grassy area, 2 lanes
2013-03-14 11:28:33	mortini	but, provides a lot of room for the future
2013-03-14 11:28:40	MonteCo[Cloud]	does anyone else have a very specific kind of mental block when it comes to solving certain kinds of problems?
2013-03-14 11:28:49	mortini	most cities don't dot hat
2013-03-14 11:28:49	MonteCo[Cloud]	I think I'm pretty clever, I can figure most things out

2013-03-14 11:29:18	MonteCo[Cloud]	and I'm going to spend the next 30 minutes thinking about it, and drawing diagrams
2013-03-14 11:29:19	mortini	changes in logic are always fun too
2013-03-14 11:29:28	mortini	i think x should work like y
2013-03-14 11:29:33	mortini	but x really works like z
2013-03-14 11:29:37	mortini	which is a different logic path

2013-03-14 11:37:42	Sisawat	What if I post about Cansei de Ser Sexy?
2013-03-14 11:38:25	D_	Then you go to /r/music and hope it's on the approved circlejerking list
2013-03-14 11:38:52	fancybone	lol @ Sisawat
2013-03-14 11:40:44	Sisawat	D_: it was on the approved circlejerking list as of last year.

2013-03-14 11:54:34	mortini	hah
2013-03-14 11:55:17	mortini	there's a jamacian patty van that parks near my subway exit
2013-03-14 11:55:26	Sisawat	jerked calamari - the original circlejerk.
2013-03-14 11:55:33	mortini	from the one place by where i used to live. they were pretty good, but horribad service
2013-03-14 11:55:39	mortini	they have 1 star on seamless
2013-03-14 11:55:44	mortini	which doesn't shock me
2013-03-14 11:56:24	fancybone	hah
2013-03-14 11:56:28	mortini	there was some guy in the back that'd make the more difficult things othe rthan patties, but it'd take him like 5 minutes to do whatever. the guy running the register would just stand there the whole time and wait
2013-03-14 11:56:30	fancybone	I don't think I particularly like carribean food
2013-03-14 11:56:42	mortini	I CAN ONLY SERVE ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME

2013-03-14 12:04:46	Kevin--	to follow my orders
2013-03-14 12:08:48	scriptor	anyone know when time warner actually charges you if you have recurring billing on?
2013-03-14 12:09:18	mortini	i think mine's based on when i tuned on service
2013-03-14 12:09:22	mortini	but that was for the cc
2013-03-14 12:09:27	mortini	not sure if you switched it for a different type
2013-03-14 12:09:39	mortini	well, i used a cc to open the account, and they re-bill that
2013-03-14 12:09:46	mortini	and it seems to be the same day i turned on service
2013-03-14 12:09:48	 *	mortini mumbles
2013-03-14 12:10:30	scriptor	hmm, I'm using cc too
2013-03-14 12:10:46	scriptor	forgot when I turned it on though
2013-03-14 12:11:37	mortini	you can't look at your bank statement to see when you were billed last month?
2013-03-14 12:15:12	scriptor	I can
2013-03-14 12:15:19	scriptor	well
2013-03-14 12:15:37	scriptor	that'd require signing into my bank
2013-03-14 12:15:44	mortini	a canwell
2013-03-14 12:15:45	scriptor	which requires using my bank's website
2013-03-14 12:15:52	mortini	ORLYNOW
2013-03-14 12:15:56	D_	That's why they made therapy
2013-03-14 12:16:48	Sisawat	OiScout: by the looks of some of the sweets on that blog, soon it will be "A Fat Girl's Guide to Taipei"
2013-03-14 12:17:54	Sisawat	but man, so many yummy things there
