2013-03-13 22:26:56	MonteCo[Cloud]	caesararum_: , I couldn't decide if it would be mean to post this on facebook
2013-03-13 22:27:01	MonteCo[Cloud]	so I'm posting it here instead
2013-03-13 22:27:04	MonteCo[Cloud]	http://i.imgur.com/fBDwAhJ.png
2013-03-13 22:27:42	MonteCo[Cloud]	unlrelated, but does this irk anyone other than me: http://www.businessinsider.com/most-successful-college-dropouts-2013-3?op=1

2013-03-13 22:28:26	MonteCo[Cloud]	if like 15 out of 19 of your "famous dropouts" were going to an ivy league school for the hardest major possible, you're not exactly selling the idea that anyone could be the next bill gates
2013-03-13 22:28:37	MonteCo[Cloud]	you're just saying that if you were that good, you'd probably already be that good
2013-03-13 22:28:48	MonteCo[Cloud]	inb4 fancybone calls me out for ranting
2013-03-13 22:28:51	Scriptor	are they trying to sell that idea?
2013-03-13 22:29:07	D_	No, clearly, everyone should drop out of college and start the next Facebook
2013-03-13 22:29:11	D_	That's just how the world works
2013-03-13 22:29:22	Scriptor	"In the end it takes an special breed of person to make it big without a degree"
2013-03-13 22:29:42	MonteCo[Cloud]	takes an?
2013-03-13 22:29:47	MonteCo[Cloud]	I don't trust this author
2013-03-13 22:30:05	athe	it's code
2013-03-13 22:30:06	D_	That's two authors
2013-03-13 22:37:44	GetsEclectic	i also suspect that most people that drop out of ivy league schools don't become bill gates
2013-03-13 22:43:24	athe	most
