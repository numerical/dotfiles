2013-03-13 22:28:26	MonteCo[Cloud]	if like 15 out of 19 of your "famous dropouts" were going to an ivy league school for the hardest major possible, you're not exactly selling the idea that anyone could be the next bill gates
2013-03-13 22:28:37	MonteCo[Cloud]	you're just saying that if you were that good, you'd probably already be that good

2013-03-14 11:02:49	mortini	[17:35:38] and they were talking about the qualifications of the new pope
2013-03-14 11:02:49	mortini	[17:35:49] i was wondering if one of the qualifications was covering up sex scandals

2013-03-14 11:02:49	caesararum_	[17:49:25] there was something similar in the pilot

2013-03-14 11:16:05	caesararum_	so you want "sim model builder" or "sim urban planner" where you build something and then don't concern yourself with how it would work in real life?

2013-03-14 11:16:33	fancybone	yeah, I just like building and decorating houses.
2013-03-14 11:16:35	mortini	but
2013-03-14 11:16:37	mortini	it was mostly just buggy as shit
2013-03-14 11:16:43	mortini	once your city gets to x size
2013-03-14 11:16:46	mortini	it just grinds to a halt

2013-03-14 11:18:11	caesararum_	and Sim City 4 is basically "transit problem simulator"
2013-03-14 11:19:52	caesararum_	I told a friend the other day that I would rather make Minecraft AIs than play minecraft
2013-03-14 11:20:12	caesararum_	I'd rather see emergent effects develop than express my own will directly

2013-03-14 11:26:58	mortini	really it's water, power, waste removal and transit
2013-03-14 11:27:11	fancybone	in real life, or in simcity?
2013-03-14 11:27:20	mortini	in real life
2013-03-14 11:28:08	mortini	like, the old parts of colorado springs are specifically studied because when they laid out the city, they made wide streets
2013-03-14 11:28:22	mortini	they're kinda like park ave - 2 lanes, grassy area, 2 lanes
2013-03-14 11:28:33	mortini	but, provides a lot of room for the future
2013-03-14 11:28:40	MonteCo[Cloud]	does anyone else have a very specific kind of mental block when it comes to solving certain kinds of problems?
2013-03-14 11:28:49	mortini	most cities don't dot hat

2013-03-14 11:29:18	MonteCo[Cloud]	and I'm going to spend the next 30 minutes thinking about it, and drawing diagrams
2013-03-14 11:29:19	mortini	changes in logic are always fun too
2013-03-14 11:29:28	mortini	i think x should work like y
2013-03-14 11:29:33	mortini	but x really works like z
2013-03-14 11:29:37	mortini	which is a different logic path

2013-03-14 11:38:52	fancybone	lol @ Sisawat
2013-03-14 11:40:44	Sisawat	D_: it was on the approved circlejerking list as of last year.

2013-03-14 11:55:17	mortini	there's a jamacian patty van that parks near my subway exit
2013-03-14 11:55:26	Sisawat	jerked calamari - the original circlejerk.
2013-03-14 11:55:33	mortini	from the one place by where i used to live. they were pretty good, but horribad service
2013-03-14 11:55:39	mortini	they have 1 star on seamless
2013-03-14 11:55:44	mortini	which doesn't shock me
2013-03-14 11:56:24	fancybone	hah
2013-03-14 11:56:28	mortini	there was some guy in the back that'd make the more difficult things othe rthan patties, but it'd take him like 5 minutes to do whatever. the guy running the register would just stand there the whole time and wait
2013-03-14 11:56:30	fancybone	I don't think I particularly like carribean food

2013-03-14 11:58:21	OiScout	all of it
2013-03-14 12:01:22	D_	I'm sure there's like 5 rich dudes in Ethiopia that have plenty of food

2013-03-14 12:04:42	scriptor	they're just going to feed you to the 5 rich dudes
2013-03-14 12:04:43	Kevin--	i suppose i could give 50 of them $1
2013-03-14 12:04:46	Kevin--	to follow my orders
2013-03-14 12:08:48	scriptor	anyone know when time warner actually charges you if you have recurring billing on?
2013-03-14 12:09:18	mortini	i think mine's based on when i tuned on service
2013-03-14 12:09:22	mortini	but that was for the cc
2013-03-14 12:09:27	mortini	not sure if you switched it for a different type
2013-03-14 12:09:39	mortini	well, i used a cc to open the account, and they re-bill that
2013-03-14 12:09:46	mortini	and it seems to be the same day i turned on service
2013-03-14 12:09:48	 *	mortini mumbles
2013-03-14 12:10:30	scriptor	hmm, I'm using cc too
2013-03-14 12:10:46	scriptor	forgot when I turned it on though
2013-03-14 12:11:37	mortini	you can't look at your bank statement to see when you were billed last month?
2013-03-14 12:15:12	scriptor	I can
2013-03-14 12:15:19	scriptor	well
2013-03-14 12:15:37	scriptor	that'd require signing into my bank
2013-03-14 12:15:44	mortini	a canwell
2013-03-14 12:15:45	scriptor	which requires using my bank's website
2013-03-14 12:15:52	mortini	ORLYNOW
2013-03-14 12:15:56	D_	That's why they made therapy
2013-03-14 12:16:48	Sisawat	OiScout: by the looks of some of the sweets on that blog, soon it will be "A Fat Girl's Guide to Taipei"
2013-03-14 12:17:54	Sisawat	but man, so many yummy things there
2013-03-14 12:24:57	caesararum_	scriptor: 4 did have basic issues
2013-03-14 12:25:04	caesararum_	the crashing always pissed me off
2013-03-14 12:25:34	caesararum_	and yes, transit is one of the main problems in any city, but some of the leaky abstractions in 4 made transit too hard
2013-03-14 12:26:39	fancybone	I saw a leaky abstraction at 34th street stop off the D train
2013-03-14 12:26:52	fancybone	it explained a lot of the smells.
2013-03-14 12:27:26	OiScout	haha, I was also wondering about her weight, Sisawat
2013-03-14 12:28:32	OiScout	just so many entrees
2013-03-14 12:32:20	MonteCo[Cloud]	serious question: A friend reccommended a CPA. He said he really liked her, and I generally trust his opinion
2013-03-14 12:32:31	MonteCo[Cloud]	thing is, the email on her website is  @yahoo.com
2013-03-14 12:32:39	scriptor	seriously
2013-03-14 12:32:42	caesararum_	so?
2013-03-14 12:32:48	MonteCo[Cloud]	is it OK to judge non tech people for their email domain?
2013-03-14 12:32:49	scriptor	tons of people still use yahoo
2013-03-14 12:32:50	scriptor	or msn
2013-03-14 12:32:53	OiScout	haha, my work email is @yahoo.com
2013-03-14 12:33:08	fancybone	MonteCo[Cloud]: you can judge, and gently steer them to something more professional
2013-03-14 12:33:10	caesararum_	if you were hiring a programmer, I'd consider that a warning sign. For a CPA it's ... eh
2013-03-14 12:33:14	fancybone	but it does not necessarily reflect on their skill as a CPA
2013-03-14 12:33:23	OiScout	I tried changing it to gmail, but the people in this industry are too used to yahoo
2013-03-14 12:33:25	fancybone	it's like judging a programmer by their choice of cuisine
2013-03-14 12:33:26	OiScout	can't change their ways
2013-03-14 12:33:26	scriptor	and yahoo's supposedly decent now, anyway
2013-03-14 12:33:41	D_	Says who?
2013-03-14 12:33:47	MonteCo[Cloud]	I don't know, we used Yahoo small business for the first year I was at this job, and it was dreadful
2013-03-14 12:33:59	scriptor	it looked shiny the last time I logged in
2013-03-14 12:33:59	MonteCo[Cloud]	though, ironically, their free offering is better than their pro offering
2013-03-14 12:34:03	MonteCo[Cloud]	pro doesn't even have imap
2013-03-14 12:34:13	MonteCo[Cloud]	you know who DID get pretty nice? AOL's new webmail
2013-03-14 12:34:24	MonteCo[Cloud]	and I hear great things about outlook.com
2013-03-14 12:35:12	D_	Give it another 30 years, and we'll get email right
2013-03-14 12:36:39	MonteCo[Cloud]	I'm actually slowly trying to move away from email and toward collaboritive documents on gdocs
2013-03-14 12:37:00	MonteCo[Cloud]	being able to edit a block of text rather than scroll through 50+ messages in a thread is kind of awesome
2013-03-14 12:37:02	caesararum_	... i.e. wave?
2013-03-14 12:37:34	D_	Ah, Wave
2013-03-14 12:37:37	D_	it was ahead of its time
2013-03-14 12:37:42	caesararum_	yup
2013-03-14 12:37:51	caesararum_	people couldn't understand what it was useful for
2013-03-14 12:37:59	scriptor	it's UI wasn't the greatest
2013-03-14 12:38:03	caesararum_	and so they used it as email
2013-03-14 12:38:10	caesararum_	no, google sucks at UI
2013-03-14 12:38:21	caesararum_	or as a forum >_<
2013-03-14 12:38:23	scriptor	they used to be okay at it
2013-03-14 12:38:39	caesararum_	really?
2013-03-14 12:39:09	scriptor	well, because they kept things pretty bare
2013-03-14 12:39:30	scriptor	but wave was clearly designed by engineers
2013-03-14 12:39:46	scriptor	with slightly more UI sense as kids taking their first VB class
2013-03-14 12:40:04	D_	I've never traced an IP with Wave
2013-03-14 12:40:21	D_	Also, don't worry, it's an open source project now
2013-03-14 12:40:23	D_	under Apache
2013-03-14 12:40:29	D_	I'm sure that'll make the UI improve

2013-03-14 13:17:11	MonteCo[Cloud]	with our product
2013-03-14 13:17:12	mortini	right
2013-03-14 13:17:15	mortini	i don't think people care
2013-03-14 13:17:39	MonteCo[Cloud]	well, I'm thinking in terms of my resume more than my business card
2013-03-14 13:17:47	MonteCo[Cloud]	although, the question is what to put on my business card
2013-03-14 13:18:31	mortini	sodomizer of goats
2013-03-14 13:19:12	fancybone	print both business cards.
2013-03-14 13:19:20	fancybone	if someone handed me a card that said "solutions engineer", I'd instantly think of them as a giant fucking douchebag
2013-03-14 13:19:26	fancybone	but I might just be racist.
2013-03-14 13:20:01	MonteCo[Cloud]	...I'm not sure I understand the solutions engineer animosity
2013-03-14 13:20:26	fancybone	"solution" sounds like an overused sales guy term
2013-03-14 13:20:33	fancybone	"no, no.. .we don't sell PRODUCTS, we don't sell SERVICES, we sell SOLUTIONS"
2013-03-14 13:20:42	mortini	...but they do
2013-03-14 13:20:45	mortini	that's what his company does
2013-03-14 13:20:46	fancybone	"and this solution looks just like a product that we'll be buying from you, along with some serices?"
2013-03-14 13:20:47	fancybone	"well... yes."
2013-03-14 13:20:59	MonteCo[Cloud]	but we do sell solutions
2013-03-14 13:21:04	MonteCo[Cloud]	that's the whole point
2013-03-14 13:21:08	fancybone	I don't actually know what you do, still :P
2013-03-14 13:21:08	mortini	you're acting like it's going into target and buying a tee shirt
2013-03-14 13:21:10	fancybone	something with cable
2013-03-14 13:21:12	mortini	instead
2013-03-14 13:21:17	mortini	they're like going to a custom suit maker
2013-03-14 13:21:22	mortini	who makes a $20k suit
2013-03-14 13:21:27	mortini	that's custom made to fit you exactly
2013-03-14 13:21:28	fancybone	mortini: I'm not saying that the terminology is wrong, I'm just saying that in my mind it's got negative associations :/
2013-03-14 13:22:20	MonteCo[Cloud]	See, I hate that
2013-03-14 13:22:30	MonteCo[Cloud]	it's like buzz words...sometimes the words actually make sense
2013-03-14 13:22:47	MonteCo[Cloud]	and we should recognize there is such a thing as synergy, not just wehn that douche from marketing says it
2013-03-14 13:23:08	MonteCo[Cloud]	I'm not saying my tag line is "We synergize your business"
2013-03-14 13:23:19	MonteCo[Cloud]	...but sometimes something really does create synergy
2013-03-14 13:23:21	fancybone	sure
2013-03-14 13:23:35	fancybone	but a business card with the title "Paradigm Synergizer" on it sets off huge fucking alarm bells
2013-03-14 13:23:46	fancybone	even if you legitimately synergize new paradigms, or whatever
2013-03-14 13:25:16	fancybone	anyway, i will never be in charge of evaluating solutions based on business cards, so my opinion is probably not too useful
2013-03-14 13:26:35	fancybone	also, rij lives near me now

2013-03-14 15:50:31	fancybone	[21:56:55] it's just more nyc people that i like and they apparently like me enoguh to tolerate me in another channel
