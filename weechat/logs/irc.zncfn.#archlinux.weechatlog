2013-03-13 22:56:03	shade34321	I'm trying to install arch on a really old dell with a p4 in it. I've partioned the 500GB drive inside of it as follows, 1MB(unformatted), 100GB ext4 for /, 2GB for swap, and the rest will be for /home. When I reach the point for install the bootloader it keeps complaining about it being a gpt partition. I saw here, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2#GUID_Partition_Table_.28GPT.29_specific_instructions , that you need th

2013-03-14 11:02:47	--	Channel #archlinux: 1573 nicks (1 op, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 1572 normals)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	***	Buffer Playback...
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:47:38] The latter, although I haven't thought about it as I'm not particularly worried either way
2013-03-14 11:02:47	glide	[17:47:42] built it last july
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:47:56] Earnestly: hehe, and my guess is the former, to not break backwards compatibility
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:48:11] as Linus Torvalds is unlikely to depend on systemd from the kernel
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:48:26] but we'll see
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:48:26] divVerent: Indeed. I think using a symlink is an elegant solution overall
2013-03-14 11:02:47	glide	[17:48:26] got something to do this evening
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:48:42] also, symlink has "precedence"... e.g. upstart also installs to /sbin/init
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:49:19] divVerent: In fact, now that I've thought about it, using a symlink should be the correct way to do it. This allows you to very easily swap out your default init
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:49:21] does Ubuntu even have plans to switch from upstart to systemd?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	grawity	[17:49:29] lol
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:49:39] I recently had a lot to do with upstart... and I hate it
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:49:42] (on the Nokia N900)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:49:47] Ubuntu is moving to systemd-logind, I imagine they will eventually move from upstart
2013-03-14 11:02:47	gtmanfred	[17:49:52] divVerent: no
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:49:55] it apparently is virtually impossible to non intrusively insert a daemon's start between two others
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:50:02] without editing other service files
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:50:09] systemd at least has the hack of inserting extra .wants links
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Chocobo	[17:50:16] Has anyone ever experienced a completely locked up nfs mount?  I can not unmount it, ls the mount... anything
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:50:18] that doesn't CHANGE other files, so it plays well with package management
2013-03-14 11:02:47	grawity	[17:50:31] Chocobo: that's kind of normal when the nfs server goes down
2013-03-14 11:02:47	grawity	[17:50:37] Chocobo: try `umount -f`
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:50:38] At least the Ubuntu dev (Matt ...someone) working on systemd/udev and now logind thinks Ubuntu will eventually have to move to systemd as, in his opinion, it's clearly better.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	grawity	[17:50:47] the -f option is there specifically for locked-up NFS mounts :P
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:50:59] Earnestly: hehe...
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:51:09] I still don't like systemd much, but upstart is IMHO even a step back from sysvinit
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:51:27] especially due to no good means to inject extra dependencies
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Chocobo	[17:51:28] grawity: I tried that.   No luck.  The interesting thing is the mount seems fine on the nodes.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:51:32] which EVEN sysvinit sort of had
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:51:39] divVerent: This guy: https://plus.google.com/107564545827215425270/posts
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:52:10] ah, good then
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:52:18] https://plus.google.com/107564545827215425270/posts/15va4vhty9T
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:52:32] "I'm now running my workstation without consolekit and only with logind."
2013-03-14 11:02:47	glide	[17:53:07] did you guys read that rant about gtk on reddit
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:53:16] the way systemd supports to inject dependencies has about the same power (or more, if you need more than 100 daemons :P) as sysvinit's numbering stuff
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:53:44] while in upstart, you can define a service that "will be started when service X is done starting", but that's it
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:53:59] making a service that has to run BEFORE the login session comes up is simply impossible to define in upstart
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:54:09] glide: I'm dubious about gtk rants because they're usually by fairly ignorant people (e.g. ignorantguru)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Chocobo	[17:54:14] No...  something very bad is going on
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:54:38] WHICH gtk rant? :P
2013-03-14 11:02:47	gtmanfred	[17:54:47] Earnestly: shit... is ubuntu going ... YES
2013-03-14 11:02:47	gtmanfred	[17:54:52] Earnestly: good
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:55:14] gtmanfred: Ubuntu won't go good. They will go bad in other ways, don't worry.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:55:16] ;)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	gtmanfred	[17:55:23] oh i know
2013-03-14 11:02:47	gtmanfred	[17:55:27] but as long as upstart dies
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Freso	[17:55:38] Wow.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Earnestly	[17:55:41] At the moment they will essentially be using systemd but keeping their upstart init.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	Freso	[17:55:41] That's awesome.

2013-03-14 11:02:47	vegai	[17:56:09] what, Ubuntu is going systemd?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	vegai	[17:56:37] or just to logind
2013-03-14 11:02:47	glide	[17:57:00] that's not it

2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:57:23] vegai: it is not YET going anywhere... but they seem to eventually plan to switch to systemd, apparently
2013-03-14 11:02:47	divVerent	[17:57:34] vegai: but the way I read it, nothing is set in stone yet
2013-03-14 11:02:47	feyd	[17:58:00] I have a simple script that checks a txt file vs. a curl command, if they're different, run a command - it's not working, and running it from a terminal does nothing, it also doesn't finish and just leaves the cursor on nothing, it doesn't return me back to the prompt
2013-03-14 11:02:47	petantik	[17:58:25] feyd: what part is failing?

2013-03-14 11:54:16	Midasx	The error is coming up before the grub menu and is only there for a split second. I'm pretty sure it is a grub error saying about a file missing. Increasing the timeout just meant I could see the menu and mashin pause break didn't have an effect. Any other suggestions?
