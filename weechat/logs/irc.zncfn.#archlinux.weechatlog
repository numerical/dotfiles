2013-03-13 22:56:03	shade34321	I'm trying to install arch on a really old dell with a p4 in it. I've partioned the 500GB drive inside of it as follows, 1MB(unformatted), 100GB ext4 for /, 2GB for swap, and the rest will be for /home. When I reach the point for install the bootloader it keeps complaining about it being a gpt partition. I saw here, https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2#GUID_Partition_Table_.28GPT.29_specific_instructions , that you need th
