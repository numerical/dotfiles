2013-03-14 12:12:30	+D_	FOUR ONE ONE TWO ONE ZERO ZERO
2013-03-14 12:12:30	AlexPortable	ah
2013-03-14 12:12:32	AlexPortable	why do you have it enabled?
2013-03-14 12:12:36	+D_	ONE ZERO ONE ONE ONE FOUR ONE ONE TWO
2013-03-14 12:12:43	+D_	Ok now somebody decode that and get back to me
2013-03-14 12:12:57	AlexPortable	D_: done
2013-03-14 12:13:01	Lara	Because I don't like PMs, especially from people I don't know.
2013-03-14 12:13:08	AlexPortable	ah
2013-03-14 12:13:13	+D_	Alright, good job
2013-03-14 12:13:14	Sisawat	D_: I believe its "mulatto butts"
2013-03-14 12:13:15	AlexPortable	huh why not
2013-03-14 12:13:20	Lara	lol
2013-03-14 12:13:25	AlexPortable	why would you not like pms\
2013-03-14 12:13:40	Lara	I don't like PMS either.
2013-03-14 12:13:46	@scriptor	they can be annoying
2013-03-14 12:13:49	Lara	PMs give me PMS
2013-03-14 12:14:00	@scriptor	like when you try to help someone out
2013-03-14 12:14:07	TL[Work]	san francisco sucks
2013-03-14 12:14:12	Sisawat	hahaha
2013-03-14 12:14:22	@scriptor	and they take that to mean you are now their personal programming assistant for the rest of the day
2013-03-14 12:14:30	Lara	lol
2013-03-14 12:14:56	Lara	What does that have to do with PMS?
2013-03-14 12:15:03	Lara	Oh you mean PMs...
2013-03-14 12:15:07	AlexPortable	yes
2013-03-14 12:15:35	Sisawat	That many people use clients with no /ignore?
2013-03-14 12:15:36	Lara	Yes that too.  Sometimes I just want to say or ask one thing in private, and get stuck in a long conversations that can be hours long.
2013-03-14 12:15:47	Lara	But I hardly PM first.
2013-03-14 12:15:51	AlexPortable	then they should get a better client
2013-03-14 12:16:04	Lara	conversation*
2013-03-14 12:17:33	Lara	I have /ignore but prefer +g because it lets both I and the other person know what's going on.  But on freenode hardly anyone knows what it even is or to check their server tab for the message (he got a message too).
2013-03-14 12:18:25	Lara	Most clients don't have an obvious notification for it but should.
2013-03-14 12:18:32	-->	Konst (Konst@he207-039.resnet.stonybrook.edu) has joined #/r/nyc
2013-03-14 12:18:47	Konst	The ammount of flaming going on in /r/nyc is too damn much.
2013-03-14 12:19:05	+D_	Just write a script that suppresses pm display and autoresponds with "FUCK OFF" instead
2013-03-14 12:19:06	AlexPortable	where does /r/ stands for?
2013-03-14 12:19:19	+D_	request
2013-03-14 12:19:25	+D_	Obviously
2013-03-14 12:19:28	AlexPortable	why request?
2013-03-14 12:19:29	@scriptor	this is the nyc request channel
2013-03-14 12:19:33	AlexPortable	it's an irc channel
2013-03-14 12:19:40	@scriptor	you make change requests for the city
2013-03-14 12:19:44	+D_	The two are not mutually exclusive
2013-03-14 12:19:46	Sisawat	you can request an NYC
2013-03-14 12:19:46	@scriptor	yes, it's an open forum
2013-03-14 12:19:50	Sisawat	or all of the nyc
2013-03-14 12:19:59	AlexPortable	idgi
2013-03-14 12:20:04	Lara	D_: I'm on IRCCloud and can't have scripts, but yes I'm thinking of requesting a feature like that (with a different auto response).
2013-03-14 12:20:04	mr_eh	if anyone's interested i'm going to be filing a request for bike lanes in nyc tomorrow at the request lodge downtown
2013-03-14 12:20:09	@scriptor	all the voiced people here work for bloomberg's office
2013-03-14 12:20:33	AlexPortable	who's bloomdberg?
2013-03-14 12:20:35	+fancybone	Lara: why in-browser, vs. using a client to connect to a bouncer?
2013-03-14 12:20:47	+D_	the cloud is the future, fancybone
2013-03-14 12:21:01	+D_	That's why everyone was using google reader instead of using an RSS client like sane people
2013-03-14 12:21:04	Sisawat	the oort cloud
2013-03-14 12:21:09	Lara	fancybone: I'm on a Cr-48 (Chrome OS) and don't have many options for IRC clients here.
2013-03-14 12:21:20	+fancybone	ah, I have no idea how ... chromebooks work.
2013-03-14 12:21:26	+fancybone	I figured you'd be able to at least install CLI apps or osmething
2013-03-14 12:21:29	@scriptor	don't you still get terminal access?
2013-03-14 12:21:37	+D_	You can install freebsd on it, probably
2013-03-14 12:21:40	+fancybone	or just ssh into a server running irssi/weechat/bitchx
2013-03-14 12:21:46	Lara	Yes but irssi is too complicated.
2013-03-14 12:21:48	+fancybone	what i'm saying is, i hate browser-based IRC :/
2013-03-14 12:21:53	@scriptor	or just use emacs
2013-03-14 12:21:54	+D_	but clooooud
2013-03-14 12:22:00	Kevin--	bloomberg is the motherfucking king of ny
2013-03-14 12:22:08	Kevin--	he tells me how much soda i can drink
2013-03-14 12:22:16	Kevin--	and he wants to limit how loud i can listen to my music
2013-03-14 12:22:18	Lara	I don't know how to do command line stuff.  But complied irssi once because I was walked through it.
2013-03-14 12:22:26	+D_	NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CLEARLY YOU FATTY, Kevin--
