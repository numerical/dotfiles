2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:03:31] Do you have some modeling like SlideShow which has a m2m to Slides

2013-03-14 11:02:48	Nebros	[17:05:22] ah lol, i tried it with P and not p -.-
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:05:24] hello. how can I select a specify a specific database for only a few of my models? (in app/models/__init__.py)
2013-03-14 11:02:48	Nebros	[17:05:33] thats why it want work. thank you :)
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:05:40] "specify a specific" huho
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:05:46] rdeguy: checkout the Meta on the model
2013-03-14 11:02:48	gp	[17:06:33] Whats up with all the snarky comments.  When I log in and answer peoples questions I don't have snarky responses.  Kind of rude
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:06:33] i thought there only was db_table in Meta
2013-03-14 11:02:48	lokai	[17:07:05] hm, what do I call .update() on? The model itself has no such method, only QuerySet    .update(F3=F('F1')+F('F2'))
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:07:53] rdeguy: maybe a router? why do you have more than 1 db out of curiousity
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:04] lokai: thats right
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:10] update is on the model manager
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:08:13] is it possible to make a model return instances of itself? i have a model i need to build some algorithims into, and it makes more sense to have a class function that takes care of the processing and returns a query set of itself
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:19] gp, early in the morning, people are cranky
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:45] VadtecWk: do exactly that
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:48] make a model method
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:08:53] in your model class
2013-03-14 11:02:48	lokai	[17:09:00] ah, so in order to get F3=myModel.F1+myModel.F3 I create an instance of myModel, call save(), then call myModel.objects.update() ?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:09:03] def something(self): print self # this is your model instance
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:09:41] lokai: i don't know what you'r doing i think you were working with apollo13
2013-03-14 11:02:48	dan00b_river	[17:09:43] gp: Tried using Grappelli?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:10:15] fission6: i have to create "shadow models" (some fields restrictions stripped) for deleted customers, they will be saved in an alternative db
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:10:33] oh like an archive thing
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:10:36] yes
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:10:44] why does it have to be in another database?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:11:03] fission6, what i mean is, i need the model to query the database for the models data so it can process it, and then it needs to pass the processed data on to view functions as a query set so it can be displayed
2013-03-14 11:02:48	rdeguy	[17:11:39] I don't know, that's what I was asked to do, they probably prefer Customer and ShadowCustomer to be separated
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:11:42] fission6, so basically, can I have a model that queries all instances of itself, or would i be limitted to a single instance
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:11:47] VadtecWk: whats the actual issue you are solving, explain from a high level the model you have and what you want your view to do
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:12:16] there is only one instance of a model, generally speaking, in the database as a row
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:12:39] so your question is unclear, tell me more form a high level about the Model you have and what you want to display
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:13:44] fission6, i have a model that is used to gather profiling data for some network infrastructure, based on the report i want to generate, i query the model in the view, process it, etc, but it makes the view code cumbersome to deal with
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:14:05] fission6, i want to move the code responsible for creating the queryset into the model itself
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:14:06] EvilDMP: cool, thanks for the recommendation
2013-03-14 11:02:48	lokai	[17:14:32] fission6, trying to make a model field F3=m.F1+m.F2. Calling m.objects.update(F3=F('F1')+F('F2')) works, but I'd like to put this call where I define the model class m. Is it safe to do this by adding this line (overrideing) to m.save()?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:14:39] so that instead of having to do all the processing in the view function it self, it is reduces to data = MyModel.get_report_X()
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:14:46] I want to have a "recent events" feed for my app -- how would you store urls to parts of the application so that they are not absolute?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:15:05] and let the function do all the processing and return the queryset to the view code
2013-03-14 11:02:48	EvilDMP	[17:15:24] tga: what do you mean by a feed?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:15:28] I would need to store something that I could pass to reverse(), right?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:16:02] EvilDMP: I have a ProjectEvent model that takes a text and an url -- anywhere in the app views can generate feed events
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:16:20] thing is, I want random views to be able to also add urls
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:16:42] obviously I can't keep the urls as strings because as soon as I move the app everything would break
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:17:13] fission6, worded another way: i need to have a model that can query all rows of itself from the database rather than just one row, as if i were executing a query for the model in a view function
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:17:49] tbh, im not sure what im asking for can even be done, so im not sure how to word it...
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:18:21] VadtecWk: a model manager?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:18:51] can  you explain one more time, again using the actual model you have
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:18:55] whats the name of it
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:18:58] can I somehow pass reverse() kwargs as text?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:19:20] or do I have to turn them into json and back?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:19:31] json?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:19:43] I want to run a reverse() with data from the db
2013-03-14 11:02:48	tga	[17:19:52] I can store the view name, but what about the args?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:19:53] fission6, the name of the model is ProcNetStat, it is responsbile for logging network data/stats
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:20:22] tag what sort of data is it?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:20:30] is it to construct a url for a model?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:20:36] get_absolute_url?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:20:39] fission6, right now, i have several view functions that query information from ProcNetStat and generate reports
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:20:47] ok
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:21:00] i follow you
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:21:12] fission6, i wan to be able to do: data = ProcNetStat.get_report_X()
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:21:29] instead of data = ProcNetStat.objects.filter()
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:21:38] yes you can do that
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:21:43] django model managers
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:21:45] thats what you want
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:22:05] fission6, kk, i havent had a reason to mess with managers at all
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:22:18] so i wasnt sure how to explain this
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:22:34] no worries
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:22:35] https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/managers/#managers
2013-03-14 11:02:48	ticketbot	[17:22:35] https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/managers/#managers
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:22:49] yeah, i just looked that up
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:22:57] you create your own custome method on ProcNetStat.objects
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:23:09] so in your case ProcNetStat.objects.get_hourly_report()
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:24:19] fission6, many thanks, this is exactly what i was looking for
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:24:38] yep
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:25:09] you also may want to check out how to chain queries, that ends up biting a lot of people who make model manager methods and then say, oh i want to chain these like filter or something
2013-03-14 11:02:48	kezabelle	[17:25:49] thank goodness for passthroughmanager ;)
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:26:13] fission6, i use chaining often, but in this case im more interested in the graphic algos I have to use, so these functions will be one-shot queries and processing, ergo no need to chain
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:26:34] fission6, and i tried chaining, it didnt lend itself well due to how the filtering works
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:26:34] kezabelle: yea, i also like http://hunterford.me/django-custom-model-manager-chaining/
2013-03-14 11:02:48	fission6	[17:26:50] Vadtec: well one step at a time
2013-03-14 11:02:48	kezabelle	[17:27:32] fission6: interesting, not seen the mixin style before ;)
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:28:06] fission6, the main reason i want to do this is i can do a single query that gives me all the information i need, where as in the view function i was having to do multiple queries for each part of the reports (in order to get the filters to narrow down the data set)
2013-03-14 11:02:48	VadtecWk	[17:32:33] fission6, many thanks again, this is *exactly* what i was looking for
2013-03-14 11:02:48	xorox90	[17:47:35] How can I delete app cleanly(including tables, file, static images..)?
2013-03-14 11:02:48	xorox90	[17:51:58] What shop framework is ready for production? Is there anyone would recommend it?

2013-03-14 13:08:00	tbaxter	Chubbs: your superuser can see everything in the admin. The content admins will only see things they have permissions to see (based on the group permissions). However, those permissions are app-level. Permissions for items in the object_list is another problem.

2013-03-14 13:11:10	dan00b_river	Alternately, if you don;t want to override ModelManager, you can also use the follow-through relation in the filter, i.e. .filter(user__groups='group_name')

2013-03-14 15:50:30	tbaxter	[22:13:04] Dulcin: ah.. I think meta or a manager would be best then.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:13:08] tbaxter: oh, totally. i generally define one there, and then override it as necessary in my queries. *most* data tends to have a reasonable ordering to it
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:18:49] Hmmmm, I just had an idea.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:18:54] Kristina: i find it hard to believe that memcache is too slow; what are you doing?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:19:11] I'm pretty sure Linux provides a thing to receive filesystem event notifications.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:19:29] inotify, sure
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:19:40] jfw: I'm not saying it's slow, I'm saying that caching the data in a process is a lot faster in terms of read access.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:20:17] that's *not* saying memcache is too slow?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:20:50] is there a method on the QuerySet class that "prepares" or "pre-process" the fields that are going to be looked up? I'm looking on the source but found nothing until now
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:21:19] mstrcnvs: pre-process how?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:21:22] it would be awesome, I need to do some-filtering before the queryset gets executed
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:21:26] jfw: It's not an issue with memcached itself, it has more to do with the fact that any IPC would result in overhead.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:21:40] Kristina: so memory is really tight?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	VadtecWk	[22:21:55] if im not using anything to invovled, will a blind upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 cause any major hickups? i have a small personal blog on the intranet here at work that i want to upgrade, but i dont wanna break it and have to rebuild the virtualenv
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:22:00] jfw: like def prepare(self, **kwargs): kwargs.pop('somefield'); return **kwargs;
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:22:37] jfw: I really want to avoid IPC in scenarios when it's not really needed. Although I guess using memcached would be more scalable in this scenario.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:23:09] mstrcnvs: err, i mean what are you trying to *do*? i know what "filter" means, but what are you actually removing?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:23:29] jfw: I'm currently doing this way http://dpaste.org/quF9O/
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:23:55] However, the data in question changes twice a month.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:23:55] Kristina: yes, definitely. that's what it's for. it's stupidly simple to set up, so try it out, and if there's too much overhead, switch it out
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:24:26] Kristina: oh, that's it? then you don't want in memory or in process caching at all--cache it to the database
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:24:27] jfw: so instead of doing queryset.filter(object_id=..., object_content_type=..) I can only do queryset.filter(obj=instance)
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:24:45] jfw: The data is read for every request.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:25:09] We need really fast reads, but slow-ish writes.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:25:17] Without restarting the web server.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:25:38] that's what a query cache is for
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:25:46] or RAM, really
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:25:59] if it's a file, the OS will keep it in RAM
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:26:08] so new reads will be instantaneous
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:26:14] don't forget about your OS :)
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:26:15] jfw: You mean mmap?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:26:26] no, you don't need to use anything else
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:27:13] If you read a file into memory, it will be cached, yes. Permamently.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:27:49] another thought I had involved having an IPC server inside each fcgi process.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:28:13] mstrcnvs: i understand your code, but i guess not your question
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:28:18] So I could broadcast a message to all FCGI workers and force them to reload the data.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:28:39] Kristina: is this system in production?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:28:45] Yes.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:28:52] Kristina: have you profiled it?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:28:54] jfw: just asking if there's a method on the QuerySet class that "prepares" the fields to be lookuped, so I can inherit it and prepare my way, instead of needing to inherit, filter, get_or_create, etc.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:30:16] jfw: Yes. Using the socket-based cache approach has two problems: minimum of two context switches per read and the overhead of deserializing data every time.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:30:43] The data in question is a multi-level hashtable.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:30:45] mstrcnvs: it seems that you're doing that already by overriding filter--i think that's really what you want
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:31:14] Kristina: i know there's overhead in those things; are they actually a bottleneck, though?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	mstrcnvs	[22:31:20] jfw: k, thank you
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:31:23] is there a good guide on very simple template tags that can reference the current user?  I'm confused between all the decorators, renderers, etc...
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:32:41] mstrcnvs: no prob
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:32:46] jfw: Not a significant one, no. But I want to do it in the most efficient way possible, up to a sensible extent.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:33:00] Kristina: if it's not a bottleneck, then it's not sensible to optimize it
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:33:28] memcache, disk, database--all sensible options
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:33:38] database with a query cache would be the best one, i think
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:35:55] FarmKing: if you're using the request and auth context processors, you should be able to access the user without an issue
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:36:07] FarmKing: what are you trying to do?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:36:57] I'm storing a number in a profile with a onetoone relationship to the user model that I'd like to make available through a templatetag
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:37:29] it seems like I should be able to return a number using a simple_tag
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:37:44] jfw: I could stick a ZMQ pub listener in the WSGI server.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:37:45] Which would let me broadcast messages across all servers.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:37:45] That's probablt the best approach.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:37:45] yeah... but why? you could also just have a cronjob (or whatever generates the data) dump it into your (shared, right) database
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:37:52] And reading it from the database requires socket IO :(
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:38:21] FarmKing: instead of just doing {{ user.profile.myattribute }} ?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:38:28] which you've said isn't a bottleneck.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:38:33] but whatever--it's your time
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:38:37] Having this cached in the actual process is around 30x more efficient than doing this using sockets though.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:39:11] that 30x could be 30 times 2ns for all i know
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Kristina	[22:39:33] Well ... yeah ... but I'm very OCD about those things.
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:39:47] but: i don't care. you're just the 2nd person in this channel today that i've tried to convince not to optimize something that probaby doesn't need it
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:39:52] :)
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:40:01] nkryptic: was hoping to use a templatetag for cachability and to leave it open for localization in the futer
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:40:52] didn't expect this to be a challenging thing to do.  Never written a templatetag before and figured this would be a simple way to get started
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Osmose1000	[22:41:02] jfw: Don't lose faith, you're doing the BDFL's work. :P

2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:41:45] FarmKing: it's pretty simple then: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/custom-template-tags/#simple-tags

2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:42:47] FarmKing: simple tag to get something like {% mytag user %}
2013-03-14 15:50:30	Osmose1000	[22:43:09] jpadilla: I saw http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4768941/how-to-break-a-line-of-chained-methods-in-python/4768979#4768979 and really like it
2013-03-14 15:50:30	tbaxter	[22:43:29] jaw <= displaying enormous patience today
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:43:42] FarmKing: or you can do a simple tag with context (then inside your tag code you'd get the user with context['user'])
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:43:47] Osmose1000, jpadilla : that's nicer than all those ugly \
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jfw	[22:45:15] and much more inline w/ PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:45:37] nkryptic: ahh!  Now I see that simple_tag *can* take the takes_context kwarg
2013-03-14 15:50:30	jpadilla	[22:45:49] jfw Osmose1000: oh that actually looks nice
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:45:49] I thought I read somewhere that it couldn't
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:45:50] thanks
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:46:29] FarmKing: to be sure, you're on django 1.5?
2013-03-14 15:50:30	FarmKing	[22:48:09] nkryptic: yes.  Did this recently change?  I have other sites on 1.4 still
2013-03-14 15:50:30	nkryptic	[22:48:52] FarmKing: no, the simple tag has been context aware since 1.3

2013-03-14 16:01:46	jfw	guhcampos: well, don't count me as that somebody--i haven't tried it. they're compatible, though, so i don't know of any reason it would be unsafe
2013-03-14 16:01:47	Kristina	So if I have a factory class, having that factory class in a global variable would be bad?
2013-03-14 16:01:51	youngster	chrisramon: it doesn't appear to be an error as much as it just skips that if block
2013-03-14 16:02:08	yacek19	jfw: it would be unnecessary job for django
2013-03-14 16:02:17	chrisramon	if {{ user.is_authenticated }} prints false, is because user is not authenticated ...
2013-03-14 16:02:23	guhcampos	Kristina: the big bad problem with globals is that you can never assume a state for them, since everybody can change them
2013-03-14 16:02:29	jfw	Kristina: yes. global variables are bad. factory classes should use singletons (generally)

2013-03-14 16:03:30	yacek19	jfw: so I open connection to redis, read sth and close connection
2013-03-14 16:03:36	Kristina	Everybody can change everything in python.

2013-03-14 16:04:51	yacek19	jfw: I don't know, unnecessary job?
2013-03-14 16:05:06	guhcampos	Kristina: if it's massive, trust me: you'll lose track of the global state somewhere in the future.
2013-03-14 16:05:25	jfw	yacek19: is it actually causing any problems, performance or otherwise?
2013-03-14 16:05:49	yacek19	jfw: nope, but I am testing it with one user for now, that is myself :)
2013-03-14 16:05:53	guhcampos	Kristina: one day you are going to modify some global for some reason and get astonished of how many stuff you broke by doing that
2013-03-14 16:05:55	Kristina	guhcampos: They are defined in a single scope.
2013-03-14 16:06:07	jfw	yacek19: okay, then change it when it actually becomes a problem :)
2013-03-14 16:06:18	guhcampos	Kristina: defined, yes, but accessed from many different scopes
2013-03-14 16:06:32	yacek19	jfw: but then, how could I do that?
2013-03-14 16:06:50	yacek19	jfw: (in case I have to act quickly and change it)
2013-03-14 16:07:00	youngster	chrisramon: I am using the default login provided by django.contrib.auth.views.login, is that relevant in the link you provided?

2013-03-14 16:07:06	guhcampos	Kristina: so one day you decide the global var CAT should be renamed to MAD, or should have a field more, or less and things start to break
2013-03-14 16:07:19	jfw	yacek19: it doesn't matter now--what i mean is, look into the problem when there's actually a problem to look into. what makes you think that one redis connection is going to be a problem in the future?
2013-03-14 16:07:19	Kristina	guhcampos: I could also use introspection to fuck with some core classes such as WSGI base classes. But I'm not going to.
2013-03-14 16:07:31	youngster	chrisramon: i'm assuming then it logs me in properly whe using that

2013-03-14 16:07:43	jfw	Kristina: remind me never to work on any code you've touched
2013-03-14 16:08:29	Kristina	Making certain assumptions is fundamental.
2013-03-14 16:08:36	yacek19	jfw: no, I would like to have one redis connection, now it makes connection for every request

2013-03-14 16:09:15	Kristina	Singleton classes are just like global variables.

2013-03-14 16:09:41	Kristina	... since singletons would rely on globals.
2013-03-14 16:10:11	Kristina	Well, not globals, but class variables.
2013-03-14 16:10:24	Kristina	Which are basically globals with a limited scope.
2013-03-14 16:10:26	jfw	yacek19: by "one connection" i meant "one per request".

2013-03-14 16:10:39	yacek19	jfw: ah, ok
2013-03-14 16:10:42	youngster	chrisramon: i believe my user is logged in, otherwise I would not be able to arrive to the url I'm getting at because I bounce to a login page if not logged in.  I have tested login/logout using the django default views for login and log out and going through my application.
2013-03-14 16:10:46	jfw	Kristina: meaning: not global.

2013-03-14 16:11:22	guhcampos	Kristina: singleton are **a bit** better than globals, but still someway problematic. There's some big hype on avoiding singletons around some dev communities.

2013-03-14 16:12:19	Kristina	guhcampos: Ah, so you suggest passing the SQL connection descriptor down the call chain?
2013-03-14 16:12:21	jfw	yacek19: no prob!
2013-03-14 16:12:49	chrisramon	youngster: a pastebin of your views would help
2013-03-14 16:13:49	Z_A_M	Anyone familiar with djangotables2 link or template column?
2013-03-14 16:14:03	guhcampos	Kristina: how to avoid them depends. Each case has it's answers. For your case you might want to take a look at the Pool Design Pattern.

2013-03-14 16:14:54	Kristina	guhcampos: So how does Django keep track of DB sessions?
2013-03-14 16:15:10	guhcampos	Kristina: I haven't the slightest idea. I'm no Django dev, just a user =)

2013-03-14 16:15:28	Kristina	Because every model somehow has access to the global database session implicitly.

2013-03-14 16:17:35	Kristina	So for the purpose of this, a class variable is the same as a module variable.
2013-03-14 16:18:06	youngster	chrisramon: I think I found my problem.  I am using HttpResponse as return in my view, where I need to pass in the context?  Here is a sample of my index view: http://pastie.org/6498980
2013-03-14 16:18:38	Skiba	Kristina i would say it's generally not good to rely on a variable to store your state, especially if another process somewhere can change it from under you

2013-03-14 16:22:24	Kristina	The only way of doing this without globals would involve opening a connection for every request and then passing the DB session around.
