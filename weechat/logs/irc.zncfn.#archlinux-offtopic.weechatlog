2013-03-13 20:56:37	thewizord	so technically conspiracy means you've begun to attempt to commit the crime, EG facilitated materials and begun to plot actually doing it

2013-03-13 20:56:48	thewizord	in his case they found no actual evidence of conspiracy to commit, purely just being a sick weirdo.

2013-03-13 20:58:32	thewizord	I will tell you that his appeals will probably land an overturned conviction since he didn't actually conspire to commit murder, so he is current convicted purely on a thought crime
2013-03-13 20:58:52	velcroshooz	thewizord: half of murika would be locked up if that were a crime
2013-03-13 20:58:52	nathan28	thewizord:  who was the prosecutor

2013-03-13 21:00:18	thewizord	nathan28: again he was weird but unless he actually conspired to commit the crime outside of talking on a fantasy website forum he really didn't commit a crime. It falls under protected speech
2013-03-13 21:00:33	nathan28	thewizord: it'll get thrown out
2013-03-13 21:00:47	nathan28	and it was a jury trial, which is so rare as to be irrelevant in this day and age
2013-03-13 21:00:59	thewizord	if you read any the trial documentation he had claimed to be in possession of the tools needed to kidnap kill and remove body parts and that he had been trailing a victim, all in accordance to the forums he was on
2013-03-13 21:01:15	thewizord	however the federal investigation found he never trailed anyone, was not in possession of any said items, and did nothing of the sort
2013-03-13 21:01:19	nathan28	lol
2013-03-13 21:01:26	thewizord	so its a thought crime, not conspiracy
2013-03-13 21:01:34	nathan28	thewizord: so the DA convicted on basis of nothing
2013-03-13 21:01:41	thewizord	basically yes

2013-03-13 21:02:07	thewizord	they took him to trail abased on the fact that he was a creeper. I agree hes weird as fuck but unfortunately you cannot put him away based on being a creeper.
2013-03-13 21:02:12	woddf2	thewizord: ++
2013-03-13 21:02:21	nathan28	well creepers actually creep
2013-03-13 21:02:31	nathan28	this guy just belonged to "EAT DED PPL" on facebook
2013-03-13 21:03:18	thewizord	the way I see it is just one more display of blatant government overreach and it is sampling peoples ability to accept thought crime as reasonable punishment... It has deeper roots than this
2013-03-13 21:03:28	nathan28	thewizord: i mean, ted bundy got hit with charges that required him to be in two places at once, but he also had handcuffs, gags and weapons in his car trunk

2013-03-13 21:04:41	thewizord	that in and of itself opens the door to more people being arrested.
2013-03-13 21:04:44	nathan28	thewizord: exactly, a fucking jury
2013-03-13 21:04:54	nathan28	you don't think the DA found the 12 most retarded ppl he could?
2013-03-13 21:05:01	nathan28	did this guy have a public defender
2013-03-13 21:05:06	thewizord	it still sets a bar....
2013-03-13 21:05:21	thewizord	I'd be very surprised if we didn't see a few more thought crime arrests in the near future
2013-03-13 21:05:28	nathan28	yeah, it means the next DA has to try and convict on basis of something without even facebook posts
2013-03-13 21:05:53	nathan28	bro you must have been up late smoking whitepridesticks with the gun nuts last night
2013-03-13 21:05:59	thewizord	it almost makes one want to test the water by making overly outlandish claims online and seeing what happens
2013-03-13 21:06:09	nathan28	thewizord: wait i changed my mind
2013-03-13 21:06:27	nathan28	it's not 'thought crime', it's 'internet malfeasance'
2013-03-13 21:06:30	thewizord	nathan28: it doesn't take conspiracy theories to see how the judicial system is being slowly turned against the general populous and they are using peer review to do just that

2013-03-13 21:51:19	taotetek	he said it while unveiling a budget proposal that custs 1.8 trillion dollars from the american health care system
2013-03-13 21:51:22	taotetek	is that enough context? :)
2013-03-13 21:51:36	numeral	not particularly, although it's more context than I had a second ago :P
2013-03-13 21:52:08	numeral	for instance, is that ALL the budget proposal does? just cuts money? does it reallocate that money elsewhere? to different programs?

2013-03-13 22:10:42	thewizord	barring costs they also found out how much more pride goes into a product made by americans that in turn produces consumers for that product, something detriot abandoned years ago to stamp a #3 at the start of their vins. MEEXIICOOOO

2013-03-14 11:02:47	cyrus1	[16:18:11] OMG! THAT'S MY PIN!
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:22:01] I have no idea what library it's missing
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:22:03] I am sadface
2013-03-14 11:02:47	dunz0r	[16:23:27] halosghost: Look at the file in question, might point you in the right direction
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:25:39] hmm
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:25:41] which file?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	dunz0r	[16:26:37] halosghost: 290 In file included from shell.c:35:0:
2013-03-14 11:02:47	dunz0r	[16:26:38] 291 compositor.h:109:25: error: field 'input_device' has incomplete type
2013-03-14 11:02:47	dunz0r	[16:26:45] That's the first error message.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:27:20] okay
2013-03-14 11:02:47	dunz0r	[16:27:42] It seems so at least.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:28:37] hmm
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:28:44] doesn't look wrong to me
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:43:37] hmm, do you have everything wayland you need?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:45:05] I thought I did
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:46:06] hmm
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:46:24] there seems to be wl_keyboard and wl_pointer instead of wl_input_device
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:47:33] I bet it would work if you compiled against 0.85
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:47:49] (and ran on that)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:48:13] hmm, good call
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:48:15] I'll look into it
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:48:21] otoh, this http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.wayland.devel/3158
2013-03-14 11:02:47	phrik	[16:48:22] Title: [PATCH weston] Convert wl_input_device to wl_seat (and friends) (at permalink.gmane.org)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:48:50] wl_seat might just be what runs on the new version
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:52:25] hmm, wl_seat may have worked fine actually
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:52:31] but it looks like there are a lot of errors
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:52:45] yeah, what's left?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:54:05] haha, give me a moment, I'll have to redo the edit and rebuild to pass you the log
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:54:10] :)
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:54:27] halosghost: you could ride the mailing list archives yourself
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:54:42] how do you mean?
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:55:12] well, they surely noted all changes on that list, so if you run into an error, there's a not about what happened to it.
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:55:37] like what I just did
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:55:54] probably, but see, I figure that what's actually happening here is that I'm just doing the build wrong in some stupid way
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:56:11] which is why I'm not focusing heavily on this
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:56:13] of course it could also be that there are more errors because the struct members may not bear wl_ prefixes
2013-03-14 11:02:47	mar77i	[16:56:29] but I'm pretty sure you're aware of that
2013-03-14 11:02:47	halosghost	[16:57:07] yep
