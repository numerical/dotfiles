This is a plugin over 3 years in the making that I've deferred releasing, primarily because it's so gosh darn hard to explain.  It's three superficially unrelated plugins in one that share a common theme: working with variants of a word.

ABBREVIATION

I know how to spell separate.  I know how to spell desperate.  My fingers, however, have trouble distinguishing between the two, and I invariably have a 50 percent chance of typing seperate or desparate each time one of these comes up.  At first, I tried abbreviations:

iabbrev  seperate  separate
iabbrev desparate desperate 

But this falls short at the beginning of a sentence.

iabbrev  Seperate  Separate
iabbrev Desparate Desperate 

To be really thorough, we need uppercase too!

iabbrev  SEPERATE  SEPARATE
iabbrev DESPARATE DESPERATE 

Oh, but consider the noun form, and the adverb form!

iabbrev  seperation  separation
iabbrev desparation desperation 
iabbrev  seperately  separately
iabbrev desparately desperately 
iabbrev  Seperation  separation
iabbrev Desparation Desperation 
iabbrev  Seperately  Separately
iabbrev Desparately Desperately 
iabbrev  SEPERATION  SEPARATION
iabbrev DESPARATION DESPERATION 
iabbrev  SEPERATELY  SEPARATELY
iabbrev DESPARATELY DESPERATELY 

Wait, there's also separates, separated, separating, separations, separator...

Abolish.vim provides a simpler way.  The following one command produces 48 abbreviations including all of the above.

Abolish {despa,sepe}rat{e,es,ed,ing,ely,ion,ions,or}  {despe,sepa}rat{}

My current configuration has 25 Abolish commands that create hundreds of corrections my fingers refuse to learn.

SUBSTITUTION

One time I had an application that with a domain model called "facilities" that needed to be renamed to "buildings". So, a simple search and replace, right?

:%s/facility/building/g

Oh, but the case variants!

:%s/Facility/Building/g
:%s/FACILITY/BUILDING/g

Wait, the plural is more than "s" so we need to get that too!

:%s/facilities/buildings/g
:%s/Facilities/Buildings/g
:%s/FACILITIES/BUILDINGS/g

Abolish.vim has your back.  One command to do all six, and you can repeat it with & too!

:%Subvert/facilit{y,ies}/building{,s}/g

You can abbreviate it as :S, and it accepts the full range of flags including
things like c (confirm).

There's also a variant for searching and a variant for grepping.

COERCION

Want to turn fooBar into foo_bar?  Press crs (coerce to snake_case).
MixedCase, camelCase, snake_case, and UPPER_CASE are all just 3 keystrokes
away.  These commands support repeat.vim (vimscript #2136).
